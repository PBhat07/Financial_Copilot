# Financial Copilot

## Overview

Financial Copilot is a modular, AI-powered platform for intelligent financial analysis, built for seamless collaborative development in Google Colab. The system integrates static financial document retrieval, live market data, and advanced large language model reasoning to deliver actionable financial insights.

## System Architecture

The core system is organised into three main components:

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Indexes and retrieves relevant content from financial documents (e.g., annual filings, reports).
* **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Connects to real-time financial APIs for current stock prices, economic indicators, news, and more.
* **LLM Agent Orchestration:** Synthesises static and dynamic data to generate comprehensive, context-aware financial analysis using a large language model.

## Colab-First Development

* All workflows are designed for prototyping and collaborative iteration in Google Colab notebooks (`notebooks/colab_setup.ipynb`).
* Dependencies can be installed within notebooks:

  ```python
  !pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Environment variables and API keys are securely managed within Colab sessions.

## Roles & Branching

| Role                    | Branch              | Responsibility                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Document/RAG Specialist | rag-pipeline        | PDF ingestion, chunking, embedding, retrieval   |
| API/Data Integration    | financial-apis      | Live API wrappers, test data, mock integrations |
| Agent Orchestration     | agent-orchestration | LLM orchestration, integration, prompt logic    |

## Example Usage (Colab)

* Clone the repository and set up environment:

  ```python
  !git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Financial-Copilot.git
  %cd Financial-Copilot
  !pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Add your API keys using the notebook or Colab's secret manager.
* Develop, test, and run each module directly in Colab, pushing code via git.

## Next Steps

* Finalize individual modules and inter-module API contracts.
* Expand API integrations (MCP) for broader data sources.
* Optimize RAG retrieval and LLM prompt templates.
* Plan for scaling from Colab prototype to production deployment.
