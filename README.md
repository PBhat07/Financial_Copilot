# LLM_script_assistant
 ## Project Overview
An AI-powered financial analysis assistant integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), live financial data APIs (MCP), and a Large Language Model (LLM). It provides comprehensive, real-time financial insights and reports through natural language queries.

## System Architecture
This project comprises three main components:

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Handles ingestion, chunking, embedding, and retrieval of financial documents (e.g., SEC filings, annual reports).
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Integrates live APIs for stock data, financial news, economic indicators, and company filings.
- **LLM Agent Orchestration**: Combines retrieved documents and live data into coherent insights using a language model.
